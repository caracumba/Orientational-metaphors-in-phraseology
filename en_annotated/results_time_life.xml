illusion? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; Can time be perceived? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; What is the time like that we encounter in our experience of our world and ourselves? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; Is the time of our lives the same as the time of nature or of history? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; In particular, if time runs through our lives, in which direction does it run 
epdf.tips

? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; Then there is Immanuel Kant&apos;s question: is temporality a feature of us or of &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; Introduction &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; the world? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; That is, is the time of our lives subjective or objective, or is there a third possibility? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; Such questions could well require much more than one 
epdf.tips

take on a different and more accessible character. &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; To pick up on the last one as an example, a major issue is whether the time of our lives is in fact merely a subjective or perceptual phenomenon, or whether it is just as real as the time of the universe. &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; One

method in contrast to phenomenology and critical theory clarifies the philosophical allegiances of this study of the time of our lives . &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; Where should a history of the phenomenology of temporality begin? &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; Strictly speaking, phenomenology in the

implies that there are only two possibilities for the source of time, the world or ourselves. &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; If temporality is the time of our lives , as opposed to the time of the universe, then a plausible answer is that temporality comes from us, unlike time, which

to prioritize the present. &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; By removing the vestiges of teleology, Derrida too can be read as emphasizing the present as the time of our lives . &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; At the same time, he does not advocate the inauthentic present with its attitude of &quot;wait and see&quot; (&quot;voir venir&quot;). &lt;/s&gt;&lt;s&gt; As he
